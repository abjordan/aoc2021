The three bits labeled V (111) are the packet version, 7.
The three bits labeled T (011) are the packet type ID, 3, which means the packet is an operator.
The bit labeled I (1) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 11-bit number representing the number of sub-packets.
The 11 bits labeled L (00000000011) contain the number of sub-packets, 3.
The 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 1.
The 11 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 2.
The 11 bits labeled C contain the third sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 3.
After reading 3 complete sub-packets, the number of sub-packets indicated in L (3) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.
