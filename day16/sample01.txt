The three bits labeled V (001) are the packet version, 1.
The three bits labeled T (110) are the packet type ID, 6, which means the packet is an operator.
The bit labeled I (0) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 15-bit number representing the number of bits in the sub-packets.
The 15 bits labeled L (000000000011011) contain the length of the sub-packets in bits, 27.
The 11 bits labeled A contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 10.
The 16 bits labeled B contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number 20.
